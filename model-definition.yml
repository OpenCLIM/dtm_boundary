  summary: >
    Creates a DTM of the chosen area of interest based on bounday input.
  source_code: https://github.com/OpenCLIM/dtm_boundary
  description: >
    This model takes the boundary of a city/ area of interest, ascertains which of the OS British National Grid
    cells lie within the specified bounday, and performs a merge of all DTM data that falls within the boundary. 
    5m DTM data for the UK is available at the 5km cell level and so the code is based on this data. Should the 
    2m DTM data become available for the whole of the UK, these can be added (in the same format) and used.

          These are metadata files stored in the DAFNI database. Using the OS grid, these folders contain
          5km squared grid cells containing rasters of the DTM for each area. ALl of the folders are zipped
          and only the relevent datasets will be unzipped.
