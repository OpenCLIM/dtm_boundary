    This model takes the shapefile of the chosen city, collates all of the DTM rasters that fall within
    the city bounds and merges them to create the DTM raster for the city.

        description:
          These are metadata files stored in the DAFNI database. Using the OS grid, these folders contain
          5km squared grid cells containing rasters of the DTM for each area. ALl of the folders are zipped
          and only the relevent datasets will be unzipped.
